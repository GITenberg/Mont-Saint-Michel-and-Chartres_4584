description: 'From the Back Cover: Mont Saint Michel and Chartres is a record not
  of a literal journey but of a meditative journey across time and space into the
  medieval imagination. Using the architecture, sculpture, and stained glass of the
  two locales as a starting point, Adams breathes life into what others might see
  merely as monuments of a past civilization. With daring and inventive conceits,
  Adams looks at the ordinary people, places, and events in the context of the social
  conventions and systems of thought and belief of the thirteenth century, turning
  the study of history into a kind of theater. As Raymond Carney discusses in his
  introduction, Adam''s freedom from the European traditions of study lends exuberance-and
  puckish wit-to his writings.'
